                    <p>
                        Being a big fan of sustainable fashion along with her project and organization experience at 
                        <a href="https://burobries.nl/" class="a-leesmeer" target="_blank">Buro Bries</a>, 
                        Floor is the right person to coordinate SuMo. Floor has a large network of entrepreneurs 
                        and one of her greatest qualities is to connect different parties. Her motto; 
                        "A lot more can be achieved together than alone" is exactly what SuMo stands for. 
                        At Buro Bries, social and environmental impact are crucial 
                        (<a href="https://socialimpactdaynoord.nl/" class="a-leesmeer" target="_blank">zie Social Impact Day Noord</a>) and 
                        this is something Floor would like to achieve during SuMo. Floor "does not leave without impact" 
                        Kuipers' enthusiasm for this topic is contagious and will inspire you. So definitely tap her on the shoulder for a chat during SuMo!

                    <h5 class="py-2 p-donkergroen">Douwe Kooistra</h5>
                    <p>
                        SuMo was originally an initiative from <a href="https://groenergroningen.eu/" class="a-leesmeer" target="_blank">Groener Groningen</a>, 
                        a collective of Groningen entrepreneurs that focuses specifically on sustainability. 
                        As one of the initiators of Groener Groningen, Douwe had the ambition to organize a larger 
                        event and by doing this, among other things, put sustainable fashion in Groningen on the map. 
                        Outside of fashion, he finds it important to show visitors and residents of the city of Groningen 
                        how many nice and green businesses this city has actually already got. 
                        Also have a look at <a href="https://beeton.eu/" class="a-leesmeer" target="_blank">www.beeton.eu</a>, 
                        the online platform that Douwe created for bloggers who write about a greener and more sustainable 
                        lifestyle, in the broadest sense of the word. Douwe "the sustainable Viking" Kooistra can 
                        passionately tell you everything about all kinds of sustainable choices that you can make. 
                        So don’t hesitate to talk to him during SuMo!!

                        Alexandra is the founder of the online platform <a href="https://myslowworld.com/" class="a-leesmeer" target="_blank">My Slow World</a> 
                        and knows the world of sustainable fashion like no other. In this personal blog she shares 
                        everything about the wonderful world of "slow fashion" and "sustainable living". 
                        So it's no surprise that Alexandra wanted to join the SuMo organization. 
                        She believes it is important to show people that sustainability is not a dusty concept, 
                        that it’s something everyone can do and that it does not have to hinder you in daily life. 
                        In fact, it is an enrichment! Alexandra van der Zee will be able to tell you everything 
                        about the current world of "fast fashion" and why she opts for a different direction, 
                        in fashion but also in other areas. Slow down and enjoy, without getting in the way 
                        of other opinions, she finds one of the most important things. Have a chat with 
                        Alexandra on SuMo or follow her on Instagram <a href="https://instagram.com/myslowworld/" class="a-leesmeer" target="_blank">@myslowworld</a>!

                        is a starting programmer who has an eye for the customer's experience. His products must be clear, 
                        easy to navigate and especially appealing to the user. When we were looking for a website builder 
                        for Sustainable Moments, there was an immediate click with Maurits. In addition to being interested 
                        in programming, Maurits is interested in a more sustainable life and is happy to inspire others to do the same.

                        When we came in contact with her for Sustainable Moments, it seemed like the perfect opportunity 
                        for Alet to take on her first job in this field. In addition, Alet understands exactly what we are looking for. 
                        Like many others, she would like to take steps towards a more sustainable life, 
                        but she does not know where to start. And then Sustainable Moments came along.
