            Sustainable Moments is a group of people from Groningen who make an effort to normalize 
            choices for the world of the day after tomorrow. Because we are all going in the right 
            direction, but we are not there yet.

                <h4 class="font-weight-bold">A more conscious lifestyle</h4>
                <p>
                    Dutch people are becoming increasingly aware of the 
                    impact of their choices on our environment and the future. 
                    Some strive actively and consciously for better, usually by 
                    opting for the sustainable option. A considerably larger part 
                    is aware of the consequences, but chooses for convenience, 
                    due to lack of money, or for other reasons for less or not 
                    sustainable at all. And some people simply deny that we will destroy the earth if we continue like this. 
                    <br/><br/>
                    Sustainable Moments is for the group of people that sees that things can be improved, 
                    but simply do not know how, or where to go. We show consumers (young and old!) 
                    how to lead a nice and comfortable life and at the same time contribute to a better world. 
                    We show alternatives; we do not judge.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Why not talk about the world of tomorrow, but the day after tomorrow? 
                    Because we're actually too late for tomorrow. Changing something today 
                    will not have a direct impact on tomorrow, but probably will for the 
                    day after tomorrow. Even the smallest changes help a lot!

                    <h5 class="font-weight-bold">Our mission</h5>
                    We want to inspire people to make choices for the world of the day after tomorrow. 
                    And to provide them with tools for making those choices. Part of this is the 
                    stimulation of the local, sustainable economy. To benefit local entrepreneurs 
                    is also good for the world of the day after tomorrow.
                    <br/><br/>
                    <h5 class="font-weight-bold">Our vision</h5>
                    If we want to save our planet, then we should all do our part. 
                    Making choices for the world of the day after tomorrow should be obvious

            <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Letâ€™s work together</h4>
            <p>
                We believe in the power of collaboration. With our partners and with sustainable entrepreneurs, 
                we want to show that making conscious choices can actually be done relatively quickly, 
                cheaply and easily nowadays. 
                <br/><br/>
                Moreover, we are committed to the local, sustainable entrepreneur. 
                For example, we make connections between policymakers and entrepreneurs 
                who already (partly) organize their business thinking about the world of 
                the day after tomorrow or who want to take that step.
